            About me: After 5 years in a help desk role I was ready to move on, and set my eyes on the Solution Architect career path. I recently earned my AWS Solution Architect - Associate certification, 
            and figured this website would be a great start to my portfolio. Hopefully we have a chance to work together in the future!

    <h3>About this site</h3>
    <p>
        This site is meant to be a demonstration of the understanding of AWS concepts and utilities. The static site is hosted in an S3 bucket, which is behind a Cloudfront distribution protected by an AWS managed https cert.
        On the backend, there is a DynamoDB table holding the visitors value to keep track of how many people have visited the site. 
        This is updated by a lambda function invoking a PUT command to the API, and the visitor counter is displayed by using javascript to fetch the visitor value from the DynamoDB via the same API.
        We are utilizing the AWS Serverless Aplication Model to save all of my Infrastructure as code, which can be found in the below Github repository.
        Finally, CI/CD is handled via Github Actions. The main.yml file for the workflows used in Github Actions can also be found in the below Github repository.
    </p>

    <h3>Github</h3>
    <p>
        https://github.com/sebster2/cloud-resume-challenge
        Github proved to be very helpful throughout this process as a way to test my code before deploying it, saving time in the long run when running into errors. 
        I can imagine this will prove to be much more useful when working on a team compared to this solo project.
